# PyBer_Analysis
## Overiew of Project
The project is to share the weekly ride-sharing data by city type. These differences will help V. Isualize make decisions later. 

## Results 
The pivot below shows the different results for each city type. According to the analysis, Urban city has the highest number of rides, drivers, and total fares. However, rural area has the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

## Summary 
Total fares tend to have a peak by the end of each month from January to April in 2019. I recommend to focus on assigning more drivers in order to fulfill demand increases during these periods. Rural city has the lowest number of rides with highest average fare. It may be due to longer rides travelled and fewer people travel to rural areas. I recommend to promote round-trip bookings in order to ensure drivers can provide discounts on the round trips. Urban city has the highest total fares but lowest average fares. I recommend to increase the fare price in order to earn higher fares.
